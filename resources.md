### Downloading R
- R can be installed from [here](http://www.r-project.org/)
- RStudio, a really nice “front-end” for programming in R can downloaded from [here](http://www.rstudio.com/) (If you’re looking to use RStudio, you still need to have base R installed)

### Interactive websites (free)
- [Code School](http://tryr.codeschool.com/)
- [Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-r)

### Books (like paper ones)
- Bob Muenchen’s books: [R for Stata Users](http://www.amazon.com/R-Stata-Users-Statistics-Computing/dp/1461425964), and [R for SAS and SPSS Users](http://www.amazon.com/SAS-SPSS-Users-Statistics-Computing/dp/1461406846/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1394593271&sr=1-1&keywords=r+for+sas+and+spss+users)
    - Also see his [website for the books](http://r4stats.com/), where there are freely downloadable and *very* succinct and helpful code snippet translations
    - E.g., in the [downloads for the Stata book](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4mP5kf41BrmM0hncl9xSDV4M2s/edit), there are files **merge.do** and **merge.r**, which have the many ways to set up a merge in each program’s syntax

## Python
<img src="/resources/python.jpg" align="right" />
### Downloading Python
- If you have a Mac, Python comes on your computer. Open Terminal and type in <code>python</code>. 
- You can also install Python with an IDLE (a prettier environment for working in the language) [here](https://www.python.org/download/).
- You can use either version 2.7.x or version 3.x. However, be aware that some older code may not work in version 3.x, and some newer features will not be available in version 2.7.x. Many developers have *both* versions on their computers.
