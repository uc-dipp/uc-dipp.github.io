It was wonderful seeing new faces at last week's Hack Harris! Welcome to the hippest club in town, folks. And thank you to the HaHa contingent who battled the Lolla crowds to attend the mapping learnathon (masterfully organized by the inimitable and apparently indefatigable Matt Gee) on Saturday. 

**This week at Hack Harris we're going to continue on with OpenRefine**, which we got a great intro to on Saturday. But worry not if you couldn't make it this weekend: We'll be starting over at the very beginning on Wednesday (@ 6pm, the Argo Tea at 16 W. Randolph). 

Here's some stuff to play around with, if you want, before Wednesday: 
- [Download OpenRefine] (http://openrefine.org/download.html)
- We're 100 percent stealing [DSSG's data challenge](https://github.com/dssg/data-challenges/tree/master/ChicagoCityOfLearning). We'll use these data sets on Wednesday. 
- Take a look at this [intro to the cluster tool in OpenRefine](http://hughstimson.org/2012/04/16/playlist-data-mining/)
We've still got a lot of summer Hack Harris nights, so let us know if there's anything you want to learn or work on and we'll be sure to incorporate that into an upcoming hack night. If there are any events you think would be interesting to HaHa / DiPP, pass those along and we could try to organize a group to go together. 

See you Wednesday!
