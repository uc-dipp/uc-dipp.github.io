Hello lovelies,

Please don't get blown away by the wind tonight... so that you'll be able to come to Hack Harris this Wednesday @ 6pm. Last week some ne'er-do-wells destroyed my old econometrics problem sets as we learned LaTeX. We also talked DIPP logo and branding (thanks for attending, Andi!). 

Participation in planned activities is optional, but, this week I've had requests to go over IPython notebook and Excel. So you can hear me chatter about those two things or bring your own work.

Hope to see you this week! As always, any questions, comments or suggestions should go to jgiuffrida@uchicago.edu or larakattan@uchicago.edu 

Lara and Jonathan
